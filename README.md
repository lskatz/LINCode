# lincodes_LK

This is an attempt at standalone LINCodes, using the script in the BIGSDB repo and a standard perl codebase.

What's included:
- scripts/lincodes_LK.pl — the main script (unchanged)
- test-anything-protocol/ — TAP tests (01_basic.t)
- Makefile.PL — declares CPAN prerequisites used by the script
- .github/workflows/perl.yml — GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on push / PR

Usage: TODO
